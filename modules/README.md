Yeah there's not much here, honestly.

The only thing here is [terminal.js](terminal.js) which isn't even supported anymore lol
It was originally created as a script to get around my school's block on Discord by using my bot as a client, somewhat. Since I had no idea how to create a website on my own I used the terminal, which is what I was using anyway via SSH.
But the school has since unblocked many things, including Discord. So I have no use for this anymore. Dunno why I even keep it here..
If someone wants to clean it up a bit and do stuff with it, more power to you.
