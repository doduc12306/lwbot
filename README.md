# LINE WEBTOON Bot
Soon to be public Discord bot.

[![](https://gitlab.com/akii0008/lwbot-rewrite/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/akii0008/lwbot-rewrite/pipelines)<br>
^ That pipeline is almost always failing. Don't worry, the bot works. I make sure it works before I push it.

Migrated from [GitHub](http://github.com/jennasisis/lwbot-rewrite) a *long* time ago.<br>
Was originally [just lwbot on GitHub](http://github.com/jennasisis/lwbot), however both of these repositories have been archived.

~~Tested in Node: v8.x - v11.x.~~ This was before Discord.js v12. v12 now requires *at least* node 12. <br>
Tested wherever Node works, including an iPhone (yes, really o.o (it was jailbroken and I wanted to see if it worked (it did)))

### ⚠️ **This bot was not designed to be hosted by someone who isn't me.**
The only reason it's on this site is because I believe ✨ open source software ✨ is important. ✨ There are so many variables here, such as the CI configuration, that are specific to myself. If you *really* know what you're doing, feel free to fork it and change those variables to suit your own needs. Maybe one day I'll make it more publicly friendly.
Now, *sure*, it will work if you're not me. I make sure it works on other environments because I frequently switch between environments. But half of the stuff you find won't be useful to you.

> If someone wants to write a wiki for me, go ahead. I'm too lazy to write one myself. Submit a PR and I'll look over it.
